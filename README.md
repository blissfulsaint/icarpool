# I-Carpool
## About
This is a web app made for the BYU-I Fall 2023 Hackathon! We chose to create a rideshare app to help improve upon the local Facebook rideshare group. We have made something that is easier and more convenient to use. 
With increased use of this app, we hope to save students money on trips and help burn less fossil fuels.
For the frontend, we built it with HTML and SASS. For the backend, we used Node.js and json to store data. You can read a little bit more about the backend in the links section below
